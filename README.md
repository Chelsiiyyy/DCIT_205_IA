HI There!!
I am Chelsea Adeniji
I am a level 200 Information technology Student in the best university of Ghana with the ID:11358105.
I am currrently working on cloning and adding a touch of my creativity to my school's department's website.
Currently, I can code quite well in HTML and CSS and hope to learn much more languages in the nearest future .
i used HTML and CSS to create or rather clone the schools website.
i also added a way through which COMPSSA students can convienintly join the family and also access sakai from the schools website.
